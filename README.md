mool: The mool build tool.
==========================

#### What is it?

* It is a collection of scripts that help building code written in C++, Python,
Scala or Java.
* It is very similar to the following tools:

1. [Twitter pants](http://pantsbuild.github.io/)
2. [Facebook buck](http://facebook.github.io/buck/)

The current implementation has been extended from another implementation of
[mooltool](https://github.com/anirban001/mooltool).

TODO: Add more installation and usage details here.
